<Madlips> This program allows the user to select one out of five possible stories in the main screen.
This is done by pressing either of the five buttons available.
The user is than taken to the next screen in which he is prompted to fill in a number of words, the 
amount of which depend on the story chosen. Hints as to what kind of word to write and how many words
are left are displayed. Words are submitted via a button. When all the words are filled in the user is
taken to the last screen in which the completed story is displayed. Via a button the user can go back to
the main screen and select a new story. The reading of the strings that contain the stories and finding
the placeholders where new words need to be filled in and returning the count remaining etc. is done with
a class ReadStory which was created by another developer.
